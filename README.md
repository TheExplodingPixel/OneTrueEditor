# OneTrueEditor
The One True Editor.
Are you tired of your bulky "editor"? Well, no more, for the one true editor has arrived!

## No Features!
OTE has no features other than entering text! No distractions such as keybinds, auto-completion, and "line editing."

## For REAL programmers!
OTE is for the best of the best! Only those who can write a file from start to finish without any errors are worthy of the One True Editor!

## Most customizable editor, ever! (Probably.)
OTE can be fully customized by simply rewriting the program! Take that, Emacs!

## Usage:
Simply type "ote", and give the name of the file you would like to edit. The file will be cleared to allow you to begin from scratch, as all REAL PROGRAMMERS begin from scratch. You will then be asked if you would like to add a line. Simply write your content and hit enter. You will then be asked if you would like to add another line. Answering no will close the program.

# REVOLUTIONIZE YOUR EDITING WITH THE ONE TRUE EDITOR TODAY!

*Real talk, this is just a small exercise for myself to practice C++, and to learn how to make Makefiles. Next step is to make packages for some distros. Use this at your own risk. I don't take responsiblity for data, time, hair, and souls lost due to the usage of the program.*
